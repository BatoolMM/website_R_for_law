<h2>Analysing student marks with the help of R</h2>
<p><em><strong>The following students attended this course:</strong></em> Student A, Student B, Student C, Student D, Student E, Student F, Student G, Student H, Student I, Student J, Student K, Student L, Student M, Student N, Student O, Student P, Student Q, Student R, Student S, Student T, Student U, Student V, Student W, Student X, Student Y, Student Z.</p>
<p>For a student to qualify to sit for examination they are required to fulfill the following:
- At least 50% class attendance.<br />
- An average of 60 % across the assessments. The lowest mark falls away and the average is taken across the remaining results, including the bonus marks that are awarded during unplanned assessments in class.<br />
- Class attendance of more that 70% can justify an additional 2% to the students average should they require it for qualification to sit for examination.</p>
<p>The course was assessed in the following manner:
- Three tests. Test one - 100 marks, test two - 50 marks, test three 100 marks. The best two out of three count towards the semester mark.</p>
