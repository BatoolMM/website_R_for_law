<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>Why learn R? For people with legal backgrounds</em> ! This is a resource designed with legal backgrounds in mind. However, if you’re here, and can take value from the resources and information shared, you are more than welcome to it! I’ll explain below what you can expect from this resource at this stage and what’s to come. Its a work in progress, and likely always will be because R is constantly developing, and as I learn and get feedback I add to the resource. To understand what the origins of the resource are, read the “authors why” post on the <em>Why R</em> tab. You can also read stories from members of the community at the same <em>Why R</em> tab. If you want to contribute a <em>Why R</em> story, please follow the following <em>guidelines</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Resources: use these to learn R or to teach others with legal backgrounds R</em></h2>
<p>Learning R, especially if its your first time is often overwhelming. In my experience, having a goal to work towards made the journey easier. The resources center containing data sets to learn or teach R and the examples provided showing what you can do are intended to inspire a goal to work towards while moving through the initial “intro to R” stages of learning R.</p>

<h2>Community contributions: why I learnt R and why I encourage learning R</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This website was created using the skills I have learnt with R. Learning a tool such as R gives you a lot more than the ability to analyse text and numbers</p>
