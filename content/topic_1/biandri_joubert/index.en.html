<h1>Biandri Joubert (author of the <em>Why learn R</em> resource and website for people with legal backgrounds)</h1>
<p>I think really reflecting and thinking about my answer to “why” or <em>why should someone with a similar background to me learn R?</em> is something that I did not think about enough over the period that I have been learning R. I started with one goal in mind. I wanted to be able to draw nice little graphs and add them to one of my PH.D chapters. I did learn how to draw nice graphs. I also started reading about text analyses and the potential to analyse text as data and what these insights might mean to my broader research topic. Trade data (records of imports and exports of products) are important in my field, so the graphs were a good starting point and genuine motivation to learn R. Word and excel had proven a nightmare in this regard and I was desperate for an alternative.</p>
<p>In the end, I also included a content analysis in my PH.D where I matched specific rights and obligations in international law (each identified by a unique number/alphabetical code) with a set of identifying key words. I then searched for the key words and thus collect data from my corpus of legal texts. Once I had these I could clean the data to the point where I was left with a data set showing unique combinations of my variables and visualise this in a heat map. Ultimately the heatmaps showed literal gaps in national legislation in my particular field of international trade law.</p>
<p>I started with a Data Carpentries course (which I did not finish because I got overwhelmed) and then progressed to private tutoring. The private tutoring that I did at the beginning is the only money I have spent on learning R. This part of the beauty of R in my opinion. You can learn a lot for free. You might just need to pay for the basics to know where to look for what!</p>
<p><strong>My why</strong> is also very strongly connected to the confidence that R gave me. My confidence grew in these areas during my initial R learning period:
1) my ability to learn a new set of skills in my 30’s<br />
2) the potential for the research that I can do<br />
3) my ability to break out of the mould of what someone with a legal backgound <em>should</em> do and rather what they <em>can</em> do.</p>
